          "Let me be honest first: the Flutter version of FluxDown worked, and it finished countless downloads for a lot of people. But every time I opened it, I knew it was still one step short of the downloader I had in mind.",
          "Its interface and download engine were squeezed into a single process, talking through an FFI signal bridge. If the interface went wrong, the downloads in flight went down with it.",
          "Multiple windows were another wall. Flutter on the desktop has no real multi-window: settings, the queue manager and task details all had to be crammed into the main window as dialogs. Just for one small quick-download window, I had to write a separate native host on each platform — C++ for Windows, Swift for macOS, C for Linux — embed a second, complete Flutter engine in it, and keep it in sync with the main window over message channels.",
          "Memory is what I felt worst about. Once that small window's engine was created, it could never be torn down — creating and destroying it repeatedly crashed — so it stayed in memory until the app quit. And to keep downloads running in the background, the entire Flutter interface had to stay resident too, even on days you never opened it once.",
          "Then there was the pace of work. Adding one button meant writing a Rust signal, generating Dart bindings, then writing the Dart model again — the same thing, twice, in two languages. Time went into shuttling data around instead of polishing the window you look at every day.",
          "So I stopped patching the old interface and started over: the entire desktop client, rewritten on a pure-Rust native UI.",

          "GPUI is the Rust UI framework behind the Zed editor; it draws the interface directly on the GPU. No WebView, no Electron, no second language — from the download engine to every pixel on screen, it's now one Rust codebase.",
          "That means fewer layers, a shorter path from click to result, and native windows on macOS, Windows and Linux. It isn't a web page stuffed into a shell. It's an app that belongs on your desktop.",
          "Multiple windows are first-class here. Settings, the queue manager, task details and progress windows are all real native windows sharing one process and one live state — open as many as you like, and closing one actually frees it.",

          "先说实话：Flutter 版的 FluxDown 能用，也陪很多人下完了数不清的文件。但每次打开它，我都知道，它离我心里那个下载器还差一口气。",
          "它的界面和下载引擎挤在同一个进程里，中间靠一层 FFI 信号桥来回传话。界面一旦出问题，正在跑的下载也跟着遭殃。",
          "多窗口是另一道坎。Flutter 桌面端没有真正的多窗口：设置、队列管理、任务详情，都只能塞进主窗口里当对话框。光是一个快速下载小窗，我就得在三个平台各写一套原生宿主——Windows 用 C++、macOS 用 Swift、Linux 用 C——再往里塞进第二个完整的 Flutter 引擎，靠消息通道和主窗口来回同步。",
          "内存，则是最让我过意不去的地方。那个小窗的引擎一旦创建就不敢销毁——反复创建销毁会崩溃——只能一直占着内存直到程序退出；而为了让下载在后台继续，整个 Flutter 界面也得跟着常驻内存，哪怕你一整天都没打开过它。",
          "还有开发节奏：加一个按钮，要先写 Rust 信号、再生成 Dart 绑定、再写一遍 Dart 模型——同一件事，用两种语言各写一遍。时间都花在了来回搬运上，而不是打磨你每天盯着看的那个窗口。",
          "所以我决定停下来，不再给旧界面打补丁，而是从零开始，用一套纯 Rust 的原生 UI 重写整个桌面客户端。",

          "多窗口在这里是一等公民：设置、队列管理、任务详情、进度窗口都是真正的原生窗口，共享同一个进程和同一份实时状态——想开几个开几个，关掉就真正释放。",

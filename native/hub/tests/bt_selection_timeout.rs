//! Regression tests for the BT file-selection timeout behavior introduced
//! in stage 6 of the fluxdown_engine decoupling (see
//! `docs/fluxdown-engine-decouple-plan.md` Verification item 5a, line 146):
//!
//! > 5a. **BT 超时行为变更验证**:针对阶段 6 步骤 24 引入的"BT 文件选择从
//! > 无限等待改为有限超时"变更,测试断言 (a) 超时阈值内收到
//! > `provide_bt_selection` 调用,返回 `UserChose` 且不受超时影响;
//! > (b) 超时阈值到期后自动返回 `TimedOutDefaulted`,任务状态机按此正确
//! > 处理(不会与真正的用户取消混淆)。
//!
//! Assertions here are grounded in the actual `RinfHostSelection::select_bt_files`
//! implementation (`native/hub/src/rinf_selection.rs`), not assumed behavior:
//! - `Ok(Ok(indices))` (answered before timeout) -> `SelectionOutcome::UserChose(indices)`.
//! - Both `Ok(Err(_))` (sender dropped, channel closed) and `Err(_)` (elapsed)
//!   map to `SelectionOutcome::TimedOutDefaulted(Vec::new())` -- an *empty*
//!   vec, not "all files"; the comment above that branch ("defaulting to all
//!   files") does not match what the code actually returns. This test
//!   documents the current returned value without editing production code.
//! - `provide_bt_selection` looks up `task_id` in the pending map and, if
//!   absent (already removed after a prior timeout/answer), only logs and
//!   returns -- it never panics. If present, `tx.send(..)` failure (receiver
//!   already dropped) is recorded at debug level as a normal lifecycle event.
